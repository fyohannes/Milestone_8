#Rough Draft of Replication Paper


  Kuipers (2019) explores the effect that the election of female candidates in the Indonesian legislature have on intimate partner violence attitudes. I replicated Nicholas Kuipers' paper “The Effect of Electing Female Candidates on Attitudes Towards Intimate Partner Violence” and I found my results to be consistent with the results found in the paper. After running the code from the main models, I concurred that the results showed that the election of female candidates did, in fact, have an effect that’s statistically significant on the IPV attitudes on female constituents. These results are particularly important because it shows the possible effect that female candidates can have on decreasing IPV, by at least contributing to more condemnation of IPV. Thus, the election of female candidates can result in tangible responses to IPV, leading to safer and healthier communities for women.
